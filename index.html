        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I buy old barns and take them apart. I take the lumber that is still good from my projects and clean it up to be sold.
            My shop is located in Houston at 3101 N Main St.

        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I created a demolition tool called 'The Bar None' that I want to sell.
